# Zifo Skills Graph

Zifo Skills Graph is currently in development but is expected to be a full-stack web application that allows the user to visualise and query the skills of Zifo employees. Understanding the skills that employees possess will aid the company with resource allocation and training organisation.

## Getting started

### neo4j

To launch the neo4j database instance, docker must be installed and then the following command executed:

```
docker run \
    --name testneo4j \
    -p7474:7474 -p7687:7687 \
    -d \
    -v $HOME/neo4j/data:/data \
    -v $HOME/neo4j/logs:/logs \
    -v $HOME/neo4j/import:/var/lib/neo4j/import \
    -v $HOME/neo4j/plugins:/plugins \
    --env NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/test \
    --env NEO4JLABS_PLUGINS='["apoc"]' \
    neo4j:latest
```

At the moment, the intermediate csv generated by `pipeline/old/etc/pipeline.py` must be added to the `neo4j/import` folder that is created along with the above neo4j database instance.

Following this, execute `pipeline/src/neo4j_load.py` to load the data into neo4j.

### Python backend

Launching the API will first require Python version 3.10 to be installed.

Once Python is installed, enter the following commands to launch the API:

```
python3.10 -m pip install pipenv
python3.10 -m pipenv install
python3.10 -m pipenv run server
```

### React frontend

To install required dependencies for the frontend, execute `npm install` from within the `frontend` directory.

Run `npm start` from `frontend` to view the d3 graph visualisation.
